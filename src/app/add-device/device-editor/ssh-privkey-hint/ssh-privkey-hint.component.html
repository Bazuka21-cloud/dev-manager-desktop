<p>Private keys are usually located in following location:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Windows: <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\.ssh</code>.</li>
  <li>On macOS and Linux: <code>~/.ssh</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Usually, you'll find files named <code>id_rsa</code>, <code>id_ecdsa</code>, <code>id_ed25519</code>. That's your
  private key file.
  <br>
  If you don't have such key, you will need to create one. Please search usage of <code>ssh-keygen</code> for more
  details.
